Envision a floating, monochromatic, desaturated sculpture of a futuristic helmet, crafted entirely from matte white plaster. The helmet's design is inspired by the sleek, aerodynamic forms of Zaha Hadid's architecture, with smooth, flowing curves and sharp, angular edges. Its surface is adorned with intricate, superflat patterns reminiscent of Takashi Murakami's pop surrealism, incorporating playful, abstract motifs. The helmet's visor is a bold, exaggerated curve, suggesting advanced technology and innovation. The entire piece hovers against a stark black background, emphasizing its ethereal, otherworldly presence, while maintaining a minimalist aesthetic.
