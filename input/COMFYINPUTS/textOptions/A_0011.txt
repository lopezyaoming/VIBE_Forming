A floating biomorphic sculpture inspired by the intricate exoskeleton of a crustacean, crafted entirely from matte white plaster. The structure features a series of interlocking, segmented plates, each with a subtle curvature reminiscent of oceanic forms. The surface is smooth and untextured, emphasizing the monochromatic palette. The design draws inspiration from the works of H.R. Giger and Zaha Hadid, merging organic and futuristic aesthetics. The sculpture's form is both alien and familiar, with elongated appendages and delicate, arching spines that suggest movement. The entire piece hovers against a stark black background, creating a striking contrast.
