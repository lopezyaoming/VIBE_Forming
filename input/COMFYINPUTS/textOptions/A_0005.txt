A monochromatic chroma steel biomorphic sculpture of a mausoleum, floating on a black background, featuring intricate metallic H.R. Giger-inspired designs. The structure is composed of algorithmically generated arches and domes, with parametric precision creating a lattice of interwoven metallic tendrils. The mausoleum's surface is adorned with digitally fabricated complexity, showcasing a seamless blend of smooth and jagged textures, transitioning through computational gradients. The metallic texture is a combination of shiny and matte finishes, with seams and points of connection highlighted by algorithmic precision. The ensemble is held together by visible ensamblage elements, showcasing the digitally optimized aesthetics of the structure.
