Floating on a black background, envision a jagged, deconstructed mausoleum inspired by the architectural prowess of Thom Mayne. This intricate structure is a symphony of fractured volumes and intersecting masses, crafted entirely from matte white plaster. The mausoleum's form is biomorphic, with aggressive, muscular design elements that reject symmetry. Mechanical systems are exposed, blending seamlessly into the structure, while performance-driven surfaces are embedded throughout. The mausoleum's sectionality and threshold complexity are emphasized, simulating structural strain. Its design is a testament to the fitting together of elements, with seams and joints meticulously detailed, creating a unique and captivating visual experience.
