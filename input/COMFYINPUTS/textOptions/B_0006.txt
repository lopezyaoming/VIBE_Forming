A floating sculpture on a black background, crafted from recycled concrete and plaster, its form reminiscent of a multifaceted diamond. The surface is textured with intricate, organic patterns, evoking the delicate veins of leaves. Embedded within the structure are fragments of reclaimed glass, catching light in a subtle, refracted dance. The edges are softened, suggesting a harmonious blend of natural erosion and human craftsmanship. This piece embodies a dialogue between the enduring strength of stone and the ephemeral beauty of nature, inviting reflection on the interconnectedness of all life forms.
