A floating sculpture emerges, a monolithic form inspired by the austere elegance of brutalist architecture, reminiscent of Tadao Ando's concrete masterpieces. This piece, suspended against a void-like black background, is crafted from dense, matte grey foam, its surface smooth yet subtly textured, evoking the weight and purity of raw concrete. The sculpture's form is a series of interlocking geometric shapes, each blocky and imposing, yet harmoniously balanced. Its monochromatic palette enhances its stark, contemplative presence, inviting viewers to ponder its mass and the interplay of light and shadow across its surface.
