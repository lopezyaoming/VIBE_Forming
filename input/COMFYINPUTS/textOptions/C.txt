A floating sculpture of a medieval crusader war mask, meticulously crafted from matte grey cardboard, evoking the austere elegance of brutalist architecture. The mask's form is a fusion of angular and rounded shapes, reminiscent of Le Corbusier's expressive designs, with a heavy, solid appearance. Its surface is monochromatic and desaturated, with minimal texture variation, emphasizing purity and weight. The eye slits are narrow and elongated, adding a sense of mystery and intensity. The mask hovers against a stark black background, creating a striking contrast that highlights its formidable presence.
