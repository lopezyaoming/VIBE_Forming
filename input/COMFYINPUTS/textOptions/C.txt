A floating sculpture inspired by Apple Inc.'s sleek design ethos, set against a stark black background. Imagine a monolithic form, reminiscent of a minimalist, brutalist architecture, echoing the purity and weight of a solid mass. The sculpture is crafted from smooth, matte white foam core, with sharp, precise edges and a seamless surface. Its form is a fusion of a cube and a sphere, creating a harmonious balance between geometric precision and organic curvature. The design subtly nods to the works of architect Tadao Ando, emphasizing simplicity and the interplay of light and shadow.
