A sleek, futuristic cyber helmet floats against a black background, crafted entirely from matte white plaster. Its form is a harmonious blend of sharp angles and smooth curves, reminiscent of Zaha Hadid's architectural fluidity. The helmet's surface is adorned with intricate, superflat patterns inspired by Takashi Murakami, merging pop surrealism with a minimalist aesthetic. The visor, a seamless extension of the helmet, features subtle, embossed lines that suggest advanced technology. Despite its monochromatic palette, the helmet's design exudes a sense of dynamic motion, as if ready to spring into action at any moment.
