A floating sculpture on a black background, a helmet crafted from recycled concrete and plaster, its form a fusion of organic and industrial elements. The helmet's surface is a vibrant pink, with intricate patterns resembling urban circuitry and natural root systems intertwining. The texture is a dynamic interplay of smooth and rugged surfaces, embodying ecological contrasts. Embedded within the helmet are small, translucent sections that mimic the appearance of recycled glass, allowing light to pass through and create an ethereal glow. The overall shape is asymmetrical, with protrusions and indentations that suggest adaptive growth and transformation, evoking a sense of ecological intelligence and social critique.
