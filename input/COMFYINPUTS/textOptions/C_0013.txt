A floating sculpture on a black background, inspired by the intricate forms of crustacean armor, reimagined through a brutalist lens. The piece is a monolithic structure, crafted entirely from matte white plaster, exuding a sense of purity and weight. Its surface is smooth yet subtly undulating, mimicking the natural curves and segments of a crustacean shell. The design draws inspiration from the works of architect Tadao Ando, emphasizing simplicity and mass. The armor-like form is both protective and imposing, with a series of overlapping plates that suggest movement and flexibility, yet remain solid and unyielding.
