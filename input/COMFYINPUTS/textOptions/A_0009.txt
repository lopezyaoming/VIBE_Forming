A floating, monochromatic, desaturated sculpture of a futuristic helmet crafted from matte white plaster, set against a stark black background. The helmet's design is inspired by the sleek, minimalist aesthetics of architect Zaha Hadid, featuring fluid, aerodynamic curves and sharp, angular lines. Its surface is smooth and unblemished, with subtle indentations suggesting advanced technology. The visor is a seamless, opaque expanse, hinting at augmented reality capabilities. The helmet's form is both organic and mechanical, evoking a sense of speed and innovation. Its overall appearance is reminiscent of a superflat pop surrealism style, merging futuristic elements with a touch of playful whimsy.
