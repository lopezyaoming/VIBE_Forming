A floating sculpture of a chubby, plush-like creature inspired by the whimsical designs of Hayao Miyazaki, set against a stark black background. The form is rotund and exaggeratedly soft, with a smooth, velvety surface that mimics the texture of felt. Its features are minimalistic yet expressive, with oversized, round eyes and a tiny, button-like nose. The creature's limbs are stubby and rounded, adding to its endearing, cartoonish appearance. The monochromatic palette emphasizes shades of grey, creating a desaturated, dreamlike quality. The overall design is reminiscent of a playful, oversized toy, evoking a sense of nostalgia and wonder.
