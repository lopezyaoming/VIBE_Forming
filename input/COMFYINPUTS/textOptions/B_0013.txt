A jagged, deconstructed sculpture inspired by crustacean armor, floating on a black background. The form is biomorphic, with fractured volumes and intersecting masses, reminiscent of Thom Mayne's aggressive design approach. The sculpture is crafted from matte white plaster, emphasizing its desaturated, monochromatic aesthetic. Mechanical systems are exposed, blending seamlessly into the structure, rejecting symmetry. The design features embedded performance-driven surfaces, with a focus on sectionality and threshold complexity. The piece simulates structural strain, with seams and elements fitting together in a highly detailed, muscular manner, evoking the work of Eric Owen Moss.
