A jagged, deconstructed helmet design, floating on a black background, inspired by the aggressive, muscular approach of Thom Mayne. The helmet features fractured volumes and intersecting masses, with exposed mechanical systems and embedded performance-driven surfaces. Matte white plaster is the sole material, creating a monochromatic, desaturated appearance with minimal texture change. The design rejects symmetry, emphasizing sectionality and threshold complexity, simulating structural strain. The helmet's biomorphic form is highly detailed, with interest in seams and the fitting together of elements, evoking a sense of futuristic innovation and complexity.
