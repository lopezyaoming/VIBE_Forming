Envision a sleek, floating sculpture on a black background, reminiscent of Apple's minimalist design ethos. The object is a monolithic, monochromatic form, crafted from smooth, matte white plastic, echoing the clean lines of a Jonathan Ive design. Its surface is unmarred by texture, embodying a seamless, futuristic aesthetic. The form is an abstract amalgamation of a smartphone and a tablet, with rounded edges and a thin profile. It hovers effortlessly, casting a subtle shadow. The design nods to the work of Dieter Rams, emphasizing simplicity and functionality, while maintaining an air of elegance and sophistication.
