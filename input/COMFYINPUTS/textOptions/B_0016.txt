A jagged, deconstructed pilot helmet floats against a black background, its form inspired by the aggressive, muscular design ethos of Thom Mayne. The helmet's fractured volumes and intersecting masses create a dynamic, biomorphic structure, with exposed mechanical systems hinting at its functionality. Matte white plaster serves as the sole material, emphasizing the helmet's intricate seams and the fitting together of its elements. Rejecting symmetry, the design blends program into structure, with performance-driven surfaces and complex thresholds. The helmet's sectionality and simulated structural strain evoke a sense of tension and innovation, reminiscent of Eric Owen Moss's architectural approach.
