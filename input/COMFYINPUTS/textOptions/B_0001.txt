A jagged, deconstructed medieval crusader war mask, floating on a black background, inspired by the aggressive, muscular design approach of Thom Mayne. The mask features fractured volumes and intersecting masses, with exposed mechanical systems that suggest a blend of program into structure. Rejecting symmetry, the mask's design emphasizes sectionality and threshold complexity, simulating structural strain. Crafted from common model-making materials, the mask's surface is monochromatic and desaturated, with minimal texture change. The biomorphic form is highly detailed, with interest in seams and the fitting together of elements, creating a visually striking and innovative sculpture.
