A jagged, deconstructed sculpture inspired by the architectural styles of Thom Mayne and Eric Owen Moss, floating on a black background. The form is biomorphic, with intersecting masses and fractured volumes, exposing mechanical systems and blending program into structure. The design rejects symmetry, embedding performance-driven surfaces and emphasizing sectionality and threshold complexity. The sculpture simulates structural strain, with an aggressive, muscular approach. Made from common model-making materials, the piece is monochromatic and desaturated, with minimal texture change, focusing on seams and the fitting together of elements.
