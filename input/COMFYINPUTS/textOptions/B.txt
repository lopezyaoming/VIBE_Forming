A floating helmet design inspired by the aggressive, muscular aesthetics of Thom Mayne and Eric Owen Moss, set against a black background. The helmet features jagged, deconstructed forms with highly detailed, biomorphic elements. Its fractured volumes and intersecting masses expose mechanical systems, blending program into structure. The design rejects symmetry, embedding performance-driven surfaces with an emphasis on sectionality and threshold complexity. The helmet simulates structural strain, crafted entirely from matte white plaster, creating a monochromatic, desaturated image with minimal texture change. The design is a fusion of futuristic innovation and architectural complexity.
