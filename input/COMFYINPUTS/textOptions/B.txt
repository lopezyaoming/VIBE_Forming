A floating, monochromatic sculpture inspired by the sleek, minimalist design ethos of Apple Inc., envisioned through the lens of architects Thom Mayne and Eric Owen Moss. The object is a deconstructed, biomorphic form, with jagged edges and intersecting masses, resembling a futuristic device. Its surface is a desaturated metallic hue, with visible seams and mechanical systems exposed, suggesting a blend of technology and art. The structure rejects symmetry, featuring fractured volumes and embedded performance-driven surfaces. It floats against a stark black background, emphasizing its aggressive, muscular design and complex threshold dynamics.
