A jagged, deconstructed sculpture floats against a black background, embodying the aggressive, muscular design ethos of Thom Mayne. Crafted from matte white plaster, the piece features fractured volumes and intersecting masses, with exposed mechanical systems that blend seamlessly into the structure. Rejecting symmetry, the sculpture emphasizes sectionality and threshold complexity, simulating structural strain. Its biomorphic form is highly detailed, with an interest in seams and the fitting together of elements, creating a dynamic interplay of light and shadow. The design is a testament to the innovative spirit of Eric Owen Moss, capturing a sense of movement and tension.
