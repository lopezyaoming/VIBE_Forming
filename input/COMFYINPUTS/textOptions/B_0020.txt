A jagged, deconstructed cyber helmet, floating on a black background, inspired by the aggressive, muscular design ethos of Thom Mayne. The helmet features fractured volumes and intersecting masses, with exposed mechanical systems that blend seamlessly into the structure. Rejecting symmetry, it showcases performance-driven surfaces with embedded complexity. The matte white plaster material emphasizes its biomorphic form, with intricate seams and elements fitting together in a highly detailed manner. The design simulates structural strain, with a focus on sectionality and threshold complexity, creating a striking, innovative sculpture.
