A floating mausoleum sculpture on a black background, crafted from recycled concrete and plaster, its form a harmonious blend of intricate Islamic geometric patterns and organic, flowing lines. The structure rises with a series of interlocking arches and domes, each surface adorned with delicate, lace-like carvings that evoke the natural erosion of stone by wind and water. The mausoleum's facade is punctuated by small, irregular openings that allow light to filter through, casting dynamic shadows that dance across its surfaces. The texture is a tactile interplay of smooth, weathered surfaces and rough, jagged edges, symbolizing the tension between human creation and natural decay. The base of the mausoleum appears to be rooted in a bed of sculpted, abstracted foliage, suggesting a seamless integration with the earth, while the upper sections reach skyward, embodying a dialogue between the terrestrial and the celestial.
