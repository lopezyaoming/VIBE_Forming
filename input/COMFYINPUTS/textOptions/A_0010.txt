A floating sculpture of a robot arm crafted from matte white plaster, set against a stark black background. The arm is intricately detailed, with visible joints and gears, reminiscent of the mechanical precision found in the works of Leonardo da Vinci. The design is influenced by the sleek, futuristic aesthetics of Syd Mead, with a touch of pop surrealism akin to Takashi Murakami's superflat style. The arm's surface is smooth and untextured, emphasizing its monochromatic elegance. Its fingers are elongated and slightly curled, suggesting both strength and dexterity, capturing a sense of motion and potential energy.
