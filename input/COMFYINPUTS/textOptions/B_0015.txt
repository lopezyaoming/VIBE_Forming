A jagged, deconstructed military helmet, floating on a black background, inspired by the aggressive design language of Thom Mayne. The helmet features fractured volumes and intersecting masses, with exposed mechanical systems and embedded performance-driven surfaces. Its biomorphic form is highly detailed, emphasizing seams and the fitting together of elements. The design rejects symmetry, showcasing a muscular approach with simulated structural strain. Matte white plaster is the sole material, creating a monochromatic, desaturated appearance with minimal texture change. The helmet's complex sectionality and threshold complexity evoke a futuristic aesthetic.
