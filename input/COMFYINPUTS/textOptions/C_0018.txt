A floating, monolithic helmet sculpture emerges from the void, crafted entirely from matte white plaster. Its form is a harmonious blend of brutalist architecture and futuristic design, reminiscent of Zaha Hadid's fluid yet commanding structures. The helmet's surface is smooth and unyielding, with sharp, angular lines that converge into a central crest, evoking a sense of aerodynamic precision. Minimalist in texture, the plaster's desaturated hue emphasizes the helmet's stark, austere beauty. The visor area is a seamless, uninterrupted curve, suggesting both protection and vision. This helmet, suspended against a black background, embodies purity, weight, and a commanding presence.
