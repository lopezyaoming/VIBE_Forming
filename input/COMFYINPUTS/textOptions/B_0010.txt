A jagged, deconstructed robot arm, floating on a black background, crafted from matte white plaster. The arm features fractured volumes and intersecting masses, exposing mechanical systems with an aggressive, muscular design reminiscent of Thom Mayne or Eric Owen Moss. The biomorphic form is highly detailed, emphasizing seams and the fitting together of elements. Rejecting symmetry, the arm blends program into structure, embedding performance-driven surfaces. The design showcases sectionality and threshold complexity, simulating structural strain. The arm's intricate details and innovative form create a striking, monochromatic, desaturated image.
