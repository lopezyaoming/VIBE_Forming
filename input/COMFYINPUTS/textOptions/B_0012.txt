A jagged, deconstructed sculpture inspired by the intricate forms of crustaceans, floating on a black background. The piece features fractured volumes and intersecting masses, reminiscent of Thom Mayne's aggressive design approach. Matte white plaster serves as the sole material, emphasizing the sculpture's biomorphic qualities. Exposed mechanical systems and embedded performance-driven surfaces highlight the complexity of the form. Rejecting symmetry, the sculpture showcases a muscular, dynamic structure with visible seams and fitting elements. The design incorporates sectionality and threshold complexity, simulating structural strain and blending program into structure, evoking the work of Eric Owen Moss.
