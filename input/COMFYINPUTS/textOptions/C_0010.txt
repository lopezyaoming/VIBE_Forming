A massive, monolithic robot arm sculpture, floating against a stark black background. Crafted entirely from matte white plaster, the arm exudes a sense of brutalist strength and purity. Its form is both austere and expressive, with heavy, solid masses that convey a sense of weight and power. The arm's joints and segments are articulated with precision, reminiscent of the mechanical designs of architect Le Corbusier. The surface is smooth and untextured, emphasizing the arm's pure, geometric lines. The overall composition is a study in balance and form, capturing the essence of industrial elegance.
