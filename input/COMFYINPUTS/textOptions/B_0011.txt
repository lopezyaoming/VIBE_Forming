A jagged, deconstructed biomorphic sculpture inspired by the intricate exoskeleton of a crustacean, floating on a black background. The form is composed of fractured volumes and intersecting masses, with an emphasis on seams and the fitting together of elements. The design rejects symmetry, instead embracing an aggressive, muscular approach reminiscent of Thom Mayne or Eric Owen Moss. The structure is crafted from matte white plaster, with exposed mechanical systems and performance-driven surfaces. The piece features complex thresholds and sectional intricacies, simulating structural strain and blending program into structure, creating a visually arresting and innovative model.
