Envision a jagged, deconstructed sculpture floating on a black background, inspired by the aggressive, muscular design approach of Thom Mayne. This piece features fractured volumes and intersecting masses, with exposed mechanical systems that blend program into structure. Rejecting symmetry, the sculpture emphasizes sectionality and threshold complexity, simulating structural strain. Crafted entirely from matte white plaster, the biomorphic form showcases intricate seams and the fitting together of elements, reminiscent of Eric Owen Moss's work. The monochromatic, desaturated appearance highlights the minimal texture change, creating a striking visual impact.
