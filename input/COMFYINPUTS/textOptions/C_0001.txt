Envision a floating helmet on a black background, crafted entirely from matte white plaster. The helmet embodies a sleek, minimalist design, reminiscent of Apple's design ethos, with smooth, uninterrupted surfaces and gentle curves. Its form is both futuristic and timeless, echoing the visionary aesthetics of architect Zaha Hadid. The helmet's structure is monolithic, with a sense of weight and purity, yet it appears almost ethereal in its simplicity. The design is austere, with a focus on mass and form, creating a striking balance between elegance and strength.
