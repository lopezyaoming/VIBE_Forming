A floating, monochromatic, desaturated sculpture of a futuristic military helmet, crafted entirely from matte white plaster, suspended against a black background. The helmet's design is inspired by the sleek, angular forms of Zaha Hadid's architecture, with smooth, flowing lines and sharp, geometric edges. The visor is a seamless, curved surface, reminiscent of a minimalist, superflat aesthetic. The helmet features intricate, embossed patterns, echoing the detailed textures found in Takashi Murakami's pop surrealism. The overall form is both imposing and elegant, with a sense of weightlessness and precision, capturing a vision of advanced technology and design.
