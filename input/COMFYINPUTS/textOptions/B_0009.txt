A jagged, deconstructed helmet floats against a black backdrop, its form inspired by the aggressive, muscular designs of Thom Mayne. The helmet's fractured volumes and intersecting masses create a complex, biomorphic structure. Matte white plaster serves as the sole material, emphasizing the helmet's intricate seams and the fitting together of its elements. Exposed mechanical systems hint at its futuristic functionality, while the design rejects symmetry, embracing an asymmetrical, performance-driven surface. The helmet's sectionality and threshold complexity are highlighted, simulating structural strain and creating a visually striking, innovative piece.
