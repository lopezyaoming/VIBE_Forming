Envision a sleek, futuristic cyber helmet, sculpted with the austere elegance of brutalist architecture. The helmet's form is a harmonious blend of sharp, angular lines and smooth, sweeping curves, reminiscent of Zaha Hadid's architectural masterpieces. Its surface is crafted from matte white plaster, exuding a sense of purity and weight. The helmet floats against a stark black background, its contours casting subtle shadows that enhance its monolithic presence. The design is minimalistic yet expressive, with a focus on mass and form, creating a striking visual impact. The helmet's visor is a seamless extension of its form, adding to its streamlined silhouette.
