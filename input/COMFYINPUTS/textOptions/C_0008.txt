A floating mausoleum, inspired by the austere elegance of Louis Kahn, emerges from the void. Its form is a monolithic, matte white plaster structure, exuding a sense of purity and weight. The mausoleum's intricate design features a series of interlocking geometric shapes, each meticulously carved with delicate, repetitive patterns reminiscent of Islamic art. The structure's heavy, brutalist mass is softened by the intricate latticework that allows light to filter through, casting ethereal shadows. The mausoleum's stark, monochromatic palette enhances its solemnity, while its floating presence on a black background evokes a sense of timelessness and reverence.
