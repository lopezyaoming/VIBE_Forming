A floating sculpture of a crustacean, meticulously crafted in matte white plaster, emerges against a stark black background. The form is inspired by the austere, expressive lines of brutalist architecture, echoing the works of Le Corbusier. Its shell is a series of interlocking geometric plates, each with a subtle curvature, creating a sense of weight and mass. The legs are articulated with precise, angular joints, suggesting both strength and fragility. The antennae extend gracefully, their slender forms contrasting with the robust body. The monochromatic palette emphasizes the purity and solidity of the design, inviting contemplation.
