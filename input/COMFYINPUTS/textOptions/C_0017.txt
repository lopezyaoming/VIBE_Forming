A floating, monolithic helmet crafted from matte white plaster, its design echoing the brutalist architecture of Tadao Ando. The helmet's form is a fusion of angular and curved surfaces, creating a stark contrast between sharp edges and smooth planes. Its visor is a narrow, horizontal slit, reminiscent of a medieval knight's helm, yet distinctly futuristic. The surface is devoid of texture, emphasizing its austere purity. Subtle indentations and protrusions suggest advanced technology, while maintaining a minimalist aesthetic. The helmet hovers against a black background, exuding a sense of weight and authority, as if carved from a single block of stone.
