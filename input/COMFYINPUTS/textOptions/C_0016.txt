A floating pilot helmet, meticulously sculpted from matte white plaster, hovers against a stark black background. The helmet's design is inspired by the brutalist architecture of Le Corbusier, emphasizing purity and mass. Its form is austere yet expressive, with a heavy, solid appearance that conveys a sense of weight and authority. The helmet features a seamless, monolithic visor, devoid of texture, creating a smooth, uninterrupted surface. Subtle angular lines and geometric shapes define its structure, evoking a sense of futuristic minimalism. The monochromatic palette enhances its sculptural quality, making it a striking visual statement.
