A monolithic, brutalist helmet floats against a stark black backdrop, its form a testament to the austere elegance of Le Corbusier's architectural vision. Crafted entirely from matte white plaster, the helmet's surface is smooth yet subtly textured, capturing light in a way that accentuates its weighty presence. The design is dominated by bold, geometric lines and sharp angles, creating a sense of purity and mass. Its visor, a narrow slit, adds an enigmatic touch, reminiscent of a fortress's narrow windows, offering both protection and mystery. The helmet's overall form is both futuristic and timeless, a sculptural masterpiece suspended in space.
