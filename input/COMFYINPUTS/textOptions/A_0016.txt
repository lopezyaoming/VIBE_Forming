A floating pilot helmet crafted from matte white plaster, suspended against a stark black background. The helmet's design is inspired by the sleek, futuristic aesthetics of Syd Mead, featuring smooth, aerodynamic curves and minimalistic detailing. The visor is a seamless, glossy surface, reflecting a subtle sheen, while the helmet's surface is adorned with intricate, embossed patterns reminiscent of H.R. Giger's biomechanical art. The overall form is both functional and sculptural, with exaggerated proportions and a sense of weightlessness, capturing the essence of a futuristic aviator's gear in a monochromatic, desaturated palette.
