A floating sculpture of a rotund, whimsical creature reminiscent of a beloved Pok√©mon, crafted in matte white plaster. The creature's form is exaggeratedly plump, with smooth, rounded contours and a playful, cartoonish expression. Its eyes are large and expressive, capturing a sense of innocence and wonder. The design is influenced by Takashi Murakami's superflat style, with a maximalist approach that embraces kitsch and pop culture. The sculpture's surface is uniformly monochromatic, devoid of texture, emphasizing its pure form. It hovers against a stark black background, creating a striking contrast that highlights its playful yet sophisticated design.
