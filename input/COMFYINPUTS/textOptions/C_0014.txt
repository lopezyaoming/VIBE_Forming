A floating sculpture emerges, a monolithic form inspired by the austere elegance of brutalist architecture, reminiscent of Tadao Ando's minimalist designs. This piece, crafted entirely from matte white plaster, exudes a sense of purity and weight. Its surface is smooth, devoid of texture, emphasizing its solid mass. The sculpture's form is a series of interlocking geometric shapes, each with sharp, precise edges, creating a dynamic interplay of light and shadow. Suspended against a black background, it appears both grounded and ethereal, a testament to the power of simplicity and the beauty of raw, unadorned material.
