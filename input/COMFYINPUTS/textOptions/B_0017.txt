A jagged, deconstructed helmet floats against a black background, embodying the aggressive, muscular design ethos of Thom Mayne. Crafted from matte white plaster, the helmet features fractured volumes and intersecting masses, exposing intricate mechanical systems. Its biomorphic form is highly detailed, with visible seams and elements fitting together in a complex, non-symmetrical manner. The design rejects seamless surfaces, instead emphasizing sectionality and threshold complexity. The helmet simulates structural strain, with performance-driven surfaces embedded into its structure, creating a visually striking, monochromatic piece that blends program into form.
