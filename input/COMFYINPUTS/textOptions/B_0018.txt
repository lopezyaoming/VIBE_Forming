A floating, intricately detailed helmet, inspired by the aggressive, muscular design ethos of Thom Mayne and Eric Owen Moss, emerges against a stark black background. The helmet's form is jagged and deconstructed, with fractured volumes and intersecting masses creating a sense of dynamic tension. Matte white plaster serves as the sole material, emphasizing the helmet's complex geometry. Exposed mechanical systems and embedded performance-driven surfaces hint at its functionality. The design rejects symmetry, instead embracing sectionality and threshold complexity, with seams and elements fitting together in a biomorphic, highly detailed manner, simulating structural strain.
