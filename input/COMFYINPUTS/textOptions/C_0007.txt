A monolithic sculpture emerges, floating against a stark black void. Its form is a testament to brutalist purity, a massive, austere block of matte white plaster. The surface is smooth, devoid of texture, emphasizing its weight and solidity. Inspired by the architectural genius of Le Corbusier, the sculpture's edges are sharp, yet its overall silhouette is subtly curved, creating a dynamic tension. The interplay of light and shadow on its surface reveals a minimalist elegance, a silent dialogue between mass and void. This piece stands as a bold statement of form, a timeless exploration of space and material.
