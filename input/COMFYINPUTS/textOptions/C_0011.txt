A floating biomorphic sculpture inspired by the intricate exoskeleton of a crustacean, designed by the visionary architect Zaha Hadid. This monochromatic, desaturated piece is crafted entirely from matte white plaster, emphasizing its purity and weight. The structure features a series of interlocking, flowing forms that mimic the natural curves and segments of a crustacean shell. Its surface is smooth, with minimal texture change, creating a sense of fluidity and movement. The sculpture's heavy, austere form is both expressive and brutalist, suspended against a stark black background, highlighting its striking contours and mass.
