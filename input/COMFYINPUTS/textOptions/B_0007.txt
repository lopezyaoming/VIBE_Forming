A jagged, deconstructed sculpture inspired by the architectural visions of Thom Mayne and Eric Owen Moss, floating on a black background. This monochromatic piece, crafted from matte white plaster, features fractured volumes and intersecting masses, exposing mechanical systems and blending program into structure. The design rejects symmetry, embedding performance-driven surfaces and emphasizing sectionality and threshold complexity. The sculpture simulates structural strain, with biomorphic forms and an aggressive, muscular approach. Seams and the fitting together of elements are highlighted, creating a highly detailed, innovative model that captivates the viewer's imagination.
