A floating, monolithic helmet design, inspired by the brutalist architecture of Le Corbusier, emerges against a stark black background. The helmet's form is a fusion of austere, geometric shapes, with a heavy, imposing mass that conveys strength and protection. Its surface is crafted from matte white plaster, lending a sense of purity and weight. The helmet features a seamless, continuous visor, reminiscent of a halo, encircling the head with a subtle, desaturated glow. The design is devoid of intricate textures, focusing instead on the bold, expressive contours that define its futuristic silhouette.
