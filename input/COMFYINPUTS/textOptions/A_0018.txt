A floating sculpture of an extremely detailed pilot helmet, crafted entirely from matte white plaster, set against a stark black background. The helmet's design is inspired by the futuristic aesthetics of Syd Mead, featuring sleek, aerodynamic contours and intricate paneling. The visor is a prominent feature, seamlessly integrated into the helmet's form, with subtle grooves and ridges that suggest advanced technology. The surface is adorned with minimalistic, superflat patterns reminiscent of Takashi Murakami's pop surrealism, adding a playful yet sophisticated touch. The overall composition is monochromatic, emphasizing the helmet's form and texture.
