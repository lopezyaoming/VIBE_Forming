Envision a floating helmet, a masterpiece of brutalist design, crafted entirely from matte white plaster. Its form is a symphony of weight and purity, with a heavy, austere presence that commands attention. The helmet's surface is smooth and unyielding, devoid of texture, embodying a sense of monolithic strength. Its contours are bold and expressive, with sharp angles and sweeping curves that evoke a sense of futuristic elegance. The helmet's design is reminiscent of the works of architect Zaha Hadid, with its fluid lines and dynamic form. Set against a stark black background, the helmet appears as a striking, monochromatic sculpture, a testament to the power of minimalist design.
