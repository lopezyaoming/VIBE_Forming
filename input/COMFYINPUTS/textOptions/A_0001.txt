A floating helmet crafted from matte white plaster, its form sleek and streamlined, reminiscent of Apple's minimalist design ethos. The helmet's surface is smooth, devoid of any texture, embodying a neo-futuristic aesthetic. Its contours are gentle, with a subtle curvature that suggests aerodynamic efficiency. The visor is a seamless extension of the helmet, a single, unbroken line that wraps around the front. The design echoes the work of Jony Ive, with a nod to the superflat style of Takashi Murakami, blending technology and art in a monochromatic, desaturated palette.
