A floating sculpture emerges against a black void, a monolithic form crafted from matte white plaster. Its brutalist design echoes the austere, expressive works of architect Louis Kahn, with a focus on purity and weight. The sculpture's mass is heavy, yet it appears to defy gravity, suspended in space. Its surface is smooth, with minimal texture change, emphasizing its solid, unyielding nature. The form is both simple and complex, with interlocking geometric shapes that create a sense of depth and intrigue. This piece invites contemplation, a testament to the power of form and materiality.
